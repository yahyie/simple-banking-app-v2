## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Database Setup

1. Install MySQL Server or MariaDB if you haven't already:
   ```
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update

   # Download and install from the official website
   ```

2. Create a database user and set privileges:
   ```
   mysql -u root -p
   
   # In MySQL prompt
   CREATE USER 'bankapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bankapp'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

3. Update the `.env` file with your MySQL credentials:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://bankapp:your_password@localhost/simple_banking
   MYSQL_USER=bankapp
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_PORT=3306
   MYSQL_DATABASE=simple_banking
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python init_db.py
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lanlanjr/simple-banking-app.git
   cd simple-banking-app
   
   # Set up your own repository
   # First, create a new repository named 'simple-banking-app-v2' on GitHub
   
   # Then configure your local repository
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/simple-banking-app-v2.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   
   # Note: Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## Deploying to PythonAnywhere

1. Create a PythonAnywhere account at [www.pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)

2. Upload your code using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-banking-app-v2.git
   ```

3. Install requirements:
   ```
   cd simple-banking-app-v2
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up MySQL database on PythonAnywhere:
   - Go to the Databases tab in your PythonAnywhere dashboard
   - Create a new MySQL database
   - Note the database name, username, and password
   - Update your .env file with these credentials

5. Initialize your database on PythonAnywhere:
   ```
   python init_db.py
   ```

6. Configure a new web app via the PythonAnywhere dashboard:
   - Select "Manual configuration"
   - Choose Python 3.8
   - Set source code directory to `/home/yourusername/simple-banking-app-v2`
   - Set working directory to `/home/yourusername/simple-banking-app-v2`
   - Set WSGI configuration file to point to your Flask app

7. Add environment variables in the PythonAnywhere dashboard for security

2. **Admin Users** - Have all regular user privileges plus:
   - Approve/reject new user registrations
   - Activate/deactivate user accounts
   - Create new user accounts
   - Make deposits to user accounts
   - Edit user information

3. **Manager Users** - Have all admin privileges plus:
   - Create and manage admin accounts
   - View admin transaction logs
   - Monitor all system transfers
   - System-wide oversight capabilities

## Address Management with PSGC API

The application integrates with the Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) API to provide standardized address selection for user profiles. The address system follows the Philippine geographical hierarchy:

- Region
- Province
- City/Municipality
- Barangay

This integration ensures addresses are standardized and validates location data according to the Philippine geographical structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, Werkzeug, Flask-Bcrypt
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF, WTForms
- **Security**: Flask-Limiter for API rate limiting, CSRF protection
- **External API**: PSGC API for Philippine geographic data

## Rate Limiting

The application uses Flask-Limiter to implement API rate limiting, which protects against potential DoS attacks and abusive bot activity. The rate limits are configured as follows:

- **Login**: 10 attempts per minute
- **Registration**: 5 attempts per minute
- **Password Reset**: 5 attempts per hour
- **Money Transfer**: 20 attempts per hour
- **API Endpoints**: 30 requests per minute
- **Admin Dashboard**: 60 requests per hour
- **Admin Account Creation**: 20 accounts per hour
- **Admin Deposits**: 30 deposits per hour
- **Manager Dashboard**: 60 requests per hour
- **Admin Creation**: 10 admin accounts per hour

By default, the rate limiting data is stored in memory. For production use, it's recommended to use Redis as a storage backend for persistence across application restarts. To enable Redis storage:

1. Install Redis server on your system
2. Update the `.env` file with your Redis URL:
   ```
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   ```

If Redis is not available, the application will automatically fall back to in-memory storage.
